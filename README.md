# proyecto-R

This project is a shiny app that I wrote for one of my classes.
This was my first shiny project.

The project centers around the history of "modern art" between the late 19th century and the late 20th century.
I welcome any critics.

I overwrote shiny's default media queries, and due to lack of time, the app is best appreciate through a desktop.
